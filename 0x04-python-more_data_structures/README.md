This folder contains more tasks on data structures. That is set and dictionary.
In the individual folders I attempt to:

0. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

1. Write a function that replaces all occurences of an element by another in a new list.

2. Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list(only once for each integer).

3. Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

4. Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

5. Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

6. Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

7. Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

8. Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

9. Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

10. Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

11. Write a function that returns all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.

12. A function that converts a Roman numeral into an integer.

The code is writing in the form of scripts with the shebang at the top and prototypes to the functions created as needed.
